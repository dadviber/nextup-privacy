        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 7, 2026</p>

        <p>NextUp - Countdown Widget ("NextUp", "we", "our", or "the app") is developed by Boosh Apps. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our Android application.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>NextUp is designed with your privacy in mind. We collect as little data as possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Data stored on your device only:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Event names, dates, and emoji selections you create</li>
            <li>Custom images you attach to events (stored locally on your device)</li>
            <li>App preferences and settings (widget layout choices, theme selections)</li>
            <li>Premium purchase status</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of this data is stored locally on your device using Android SharedPreferences and local file storage. We do not transmit, upload, or sync this data to any external server.</p>

        <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>We want to be clear about what we do not do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
            <li>We do not track your location</li>
            <li>We do not use analytics or tracking SDKs</li>
            <li>We do not serve advertisements</li>
            <li>We do not share any data with third parties</li>
            <li>We do not have user accounts or require registration</li>
            <li>We do not access your contacts, camera, microphone, or phone calls</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Calendar Access</h2>
        <p>If you choose to import events from your device calendar, NextUp will request read access to your calendar. This access is used solely to display your existing calendar events within the app so you can create countdowns from them. Calendar data is read on-device only and is never transmitted externally.</p>

        <h2>Photo Access</h2>
        <p>If you choose to add custom images to your events (a Premium feature), NextUp will request access to your device storage or photo library. Selected images are copied to the app's private storage on your device. They are never uploaded to any server.</p>

        <h2>Google Play Billing</h2>
        <p>NextUp offers a one-time Premium upgrade through Google Play's in-app purchase system. All payment processing is handled entirely by Google Play. We do not collect, store, or have access to any payment or financial information.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>NextUp is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Since the app does not collect personal data from any user, there is no risk of inadvertent collection of children's data.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it at all times. You can delete individual events within the app, or remove all app data by uninstalling NextUp or clearing its data through your device's Settings. No data persists on any external server after removal.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>NextUp uses the following third-party service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play Billing</strong> — for processing the one-time Premium purchase. Google's privacy policy applies to payment processing: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><strong>Google Play In-App Review API</strong> — to optionally prompt users for a review. No personal data is shared through this API beyond what Google Play already has.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored in the app's private storage directory on your Android device, which is sandboxed by the Android operating system and not accessible to other apps. We take reasonable measures to ensure the app does not expose your data, but no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
